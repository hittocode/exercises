-----------------what you can do with it-------------
- JavaScript is a "real" programming language
	- store variables
	- set decision points
	- looping	
	- reuse code with functions
- In addition
	- get data from the browser
	- manipulate the DOM that browsers use to create web pages
 
-----------Variables----------------
- store data and refer back to it later

--------------Decision Points--------------
- Use control statements to decide which code to run under different circumstances

------------Looping-------------
- avoid writing the same (or similar) code over and over again
- determine at runtimes how many times you want to run some code

-----------functions-------------
- reuse code multiple times, but only write it once
- Use code from others

-----------Manipulating the DOM--------------
- Javascript can find, add and delete elements from the DOM
- Can also react to mouse clicks, page reloads, and other actions

--------------review-------------
- a major component of learning any programming language is practice and repetition
- expect to make mistakes
	- if you aren't making mistakes, you aren't learning
