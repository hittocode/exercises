----------------------Web Pages are built upon the DOM---------------
- Document Object Model
- Structures documents like a tree
- Every node has one parent, and possibly many children
- Nodes have properties, methods and events

-------------The DOM and JavaScript---------------
- Page content is represented by the DOM
- Scripting languages (JavaScript) use the DOM to interact with the document

-------------------how Does it work?-----------
- Accessing the DOM is done with an API - Application Programming Interface
	- No matter which browser, no matter which scripting language, the API is the same

----------------The DOM objects/elements----------------
- document- the root of the page
	- document.URI, document.height, document.links, document.bgColor, ...
	- element - a node in the tree
		- returned by a member of the API
- nodeList - an array (group) of elements
	- document.getElementByTagName('p') would return a set of nodes
- attribute
	- a node in the DOM, though rarely used that way. Another way to manipulate/change the document

-------------------Specific APIs--------------
- document.getElementById(id)
- document.getElementsByClassName(class)
- element.innerHTML
- element.style
- element.setAttribute(attribute, value)
- element.removeAttribute(attribute)

------------------Review--------------------
- As you learn more JavaScript, you will be able to use the APIs
- We will start slow, but the important part is to eventually feel comfortable searching for these tools
