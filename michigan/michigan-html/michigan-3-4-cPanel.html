---------Connecting to CPanel-------
- You will need to have the URL for your cPanel account.
- Usually a version of your domain name or your hosting service domain name

---------File Manager----------
- Regardless of the cPanel configuration, every system should have a File Manager
- From the File Manager, search for the public_html (or in some cases, just public) folder

---------public_html-----------
- your site will have a lot of files, some that you want people to see, some that you don't
- uploading files to the public_html folder should make them viewable to the public

-----Wait? Why can't I view my file?---------
- You typed in the wrong URL
- When you uploaded the file the transfer didn't work
- When you uploaded the file, it did not have "read access"

---------Working locally-------------
- It is possible to edit your files via cPanel but I didn't do that.
- Changes are immediately public
- Less opportunity to test and debug

---------Review-----------
- Versions of cPanel often differ depending on if you are using paid or free site
- Offers many administrative tools (email accounts, database management, cron jobs)
-- An alternative is to use sftp to transfer files
