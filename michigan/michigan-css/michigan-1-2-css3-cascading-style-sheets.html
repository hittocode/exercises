----------Browser Default Styling----------3:43
- The same html file may look different when viewed on different browsers
- Some tags are supported, some aren't.
- Browsers may have different default styles
- In general, default looks are plain

----------Adding style------------
- As styling tags were phased out of html, styling was done with style attribute
 <h1 style="color:blue">Styled Heading</h1>

-----------Cascading Style Sheet--------------
- CSS defined generic rules that can apply to multiple elements 

selector {
	property: value;
}

ex:

h1 {
	color: blue;
}

-------------Rules Syntax---------------
- Brackets and semicolons are very important
- This is where a good editor can make a BIG difference

/* This is how comments in CSS are done */


-----------Multiple Properties------------

h1 {
	color: blue;
	background-color: yellow;
}

---------Internal Style Sheet----------
- Styling is defined within <head>
- Rules are defined within <style>
- Styles are applied to all elements in that file
- Don't forget to close the style tag!

<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<title>Title here</title>
	<style>
	</style>
</head>


----------External Style Sheet-----------
- You can put rules in an external file (don't use the style tag!)
- A link to the style sheet is put in the head section
- Styles are applied to all elements in all files that links to the style sheet

<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

----------The "Cascading" part of CSS------------
- Browser default
- External style sheets
- Internal style (in the head section)
- Inline style (inside an HTML element)

---------------- Rule precedence---------
- What if one selector is defined in two external files? The rules from the most recent file have precedence
- What if one selector has more than one rule in the same file? The MOST RECENT rule has precedence.

----------!important----------
- It is possible to override later rules, use !important

h1 {
	color: blue;s
	font-family: Arial !important;
}

-----------------REVIEW-----------
- Why do we want/need to separate content from formatting?
- How does this also tie in to external/internal style sheets?
- Understand that this is very powerful. See http://www.csszengarden.com/
