----------------Navigation------------------
- Navigation is a critical aspect of accessibility
- Sighted users have tried and true visual cues to orient them on a page
	- Banner
	- Search box
	- Main navigation box
	- Content well

- Blind and low-vision users rely on proper coding of page for orientation

---------------What if you can't see?--------------
- Title of page lets you know what page you're on when page loads
- Proper heading placement and hierarchy conveys organization of page and allows SR (screen-readers) user to skip navigation
- Link descriptions convey content of page and organization of site

-----------------------Proper heading hierarchy-------------------
- Headings need to be properly nested to convey organization of the page
- <h2> tags follow the <h1> tag, the <h3> tags follow the <h2> tags, etc...

example:  

<h1></h1> (header)
	<h2></h2> (section)
		<h3></h3> (sub-section)
		<h3></h3>	(sub-section)
	<h2></h2> (section)
	<h2></h2> (section)

-----------Off-page headings-------------
- Useful when you want to give a SR users a navigational aid without cluttering presentation
- Use CSS to position headings off-page
- Super-useful to allow people to jump to where they need 
- Don't use {display:none} or {visibility:hidden}

.offpage {
	position: absolute;
	left: -1000px;
}

--------------Meaningful Link Text--------------
- Screen readers can find and list links
- Descriptions for the links must be meaningful out of context, via tabbing or presented in a list
- Don't use "here", "click here", "read this", and "more"
- Don't use URL as a link description - will sound like gibberish, unless very short and intuitive
