-----------Color Conventions-------------
- Color names (blue, red, yellow, etc) work, but should be avoided
- Hexadecimal is common convention. #0000FF, #FF0000, #FFFF00 (blue, red, yellow) (most common)
- rgb (0,0,1) (1,0,0) (1, 1, 0) blue/red/yellow
- rgba (0,0,1, .5) 

--------Accessibility-------------
- Appropriate use of color is critical to web accessibility
- Many more people are visually impaired or color blind than are legally blind

---------What is color contrast?----------
