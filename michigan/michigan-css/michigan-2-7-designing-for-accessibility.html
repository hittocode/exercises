-------------Overview----------------
- The content of your page should be in HTML.
- It is tempting to add content via colors, images, etc...
- Follow the POUR guidelines
	- Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust

---------Perceivable--------------
- Provide text alternatives for images
- Provide captions and transcripts for videos and audios
- Use correct semantic markup so content can be presented in different ways (use <navhead>, <figure> tag instead of image)
- Make it easier for users to see content by using good color contrast

--------Operable--------------------
- All functionality available from the keyboard!
- Users have control over timing and limits
- Do not cause seizures (don't flash content)
- Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

----------------Understandable------------------
- Economical and plain use of language
- Text supplemented with illustrations, videos, and other formats where appropriate (i.e., use good Universal Design)
- Navigation, information structure are discernable and consistent
- Make pages operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

--------------Robust-------------
- Is your site functional across various technologies (smartphones, screen-readers, laptops, pensticks, etc...)?
- Syntax errors that don't affect visual presentation may hamper assistive technology and accessibility tools
- Adhering to W3C standards ensures future compatibility
- validate your code at validator.w3c.org and wave.webaim.org

----------------------Review--------------------
- accessibility starts with proper HTML tags
- styling can actually make it HARDER for some people to access the information
- Get into the early habit of utilizing accessibility tools
- "Cool" new style should not be at the cost of accessibility
