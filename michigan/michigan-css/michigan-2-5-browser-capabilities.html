-----------Browsers Differ---------------
- Even though browsers are moving to a consistent implementation of HTML, they differ in display and aherence
- It is your responsibility to make sure your page works for a wide audience

------------Handling Stylistic Differences-------------
- "easiest" way to eliminate browser differences is to use a default style sheet
- Default style sheets reset all of the values for the page
- Will make your page look worse!

---------Handling unsupported properties---------------
- Not all browsers support all HTML5 tags
- Not all browsers support all CSS3 properties
- Browser prefixes (or vendor prefixes) provide a quick fix for handling unsupported CSS3 options

---------Browser Prefixes------------------
- -webkit-:Android, Chrome, iOS, Safari
- -mox-:Firefox
- -ms-:Internet Explorer
- -o-: Opera

----------often unsupported properties------------
- column-count
- border-radius
- gradient
- sites such as http://caniuse.com/ will tell you when you need to use prefixes

-----------Example--------------

-----------Automated ways to include prefixes-----------
- For now, add the prefixes by hand
- there are ways to automate the addition of prefixes 
	- Editor add-ons (You have most of the control)
 	- Use outside programs to dynamically add appropriate prefix based on browser

-----------REVIEW--------------
- Default style sheets remove stylistic differences
	- Should default style sheet be internal or external?
	- Where should it go in relation to other style sheets?
- Browser prefixes can help remove some differences caused by unsupported options
	- Shouldn't be overused
