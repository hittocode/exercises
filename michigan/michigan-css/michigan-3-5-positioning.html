-------------Position Properties--------------------
- The four position properties are:
	- static
	- relative 
	- absolute
	- fixed

- Position are modified by the properties: top, right, bottom, left

-----------static---------------
- Default value for elements
- Place in the next available position
- Not affected by the top, bottom, left and right properties

------------Relative-------------
- Positioned "relative to itself"
- Take the static position, but add offsets
- The new positioning does NOT affect any other element. It is possible to move an element and leave a big hole where it would have been.
- Relative positioned elements are often usued as container blocks for other elements.

-----------absolute---------------
- element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to it's -nearest ancestor- (or the root)
- Other elements behave as if element does not exist
- Can end up on top of another element

------------Fixed--------------
- positioned relative to the browser window
- Will not move, even if the window is scrolled
	- IE7 and IE8 support the fixed value only if a !DOCTYPE is specified
- Think of popup boxes that won't go away!
- Or a navigation bar that is always visible on the top

--------------z-index------------------
- Multiple elements may be placed in the same position
- z-index is a numeric value, positive or negative that dictates stacking order

------------REVIEW---------------
- Positioning elements is key to achieving desired layouts
- Proper planning will make this easier
