------------------Objective---------------
- Create your own unique style sheet that will be used by three different html files.

----------------Getting started-----------------
- You must complete the first Peer Graded Assignment to begin this one
- You can alter your previous styling choices but I assume those changes are complete

-----------You must leave the HTML alone---------------
- Create a single style sheet that updates:
	- body, header, h1, the links, the active, left, and right classes, and the images in the left class

------------body-----------------
- change the padding and margin
- feel free to adjust the size of the text, but it is not required

----------header--------------
-change background color
- add background image, using the image provided in the css folder
	- if you have trouble with this part, keep an eye out for sample code in cal-table.css. The key is to master the folder structure

---------h1-----------
- change the font color
- increase the font size

----------------the navigation links---------------
- Style ONLY those links in the nav element
- You don't need to recreate my example exactly, but they should be spaced apart
- make sure to round the borders and removed the underline

------------active class------------------
- use the background color and font color to create an active class
- this class is used to distinguish the current page from the others

-------------left and right class---------------
- these two elements should be side-by-side
- change the background color for the left class

--------------images-------------
- put the images back in and put a border around them
- make sure that they are centered within the .left class
- put spacing between them to the top and bottom too
