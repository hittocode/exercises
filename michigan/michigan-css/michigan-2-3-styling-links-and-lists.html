-------------Anchor Links-----------------
- Links can take on all of the usual styles as well as text-decoration
- Links by default are inline

a {
	display: block;
	font-weight: bold;
	color: #ffffff;
	background-color: #0006CC;
	width: 200px;
	text-align: center;
	padding: 4px;
	text-decoration: none;
}

-----------Buttons------------
- Many designers try to make their links look like buttons
- Be semantic, if you want a button use the <button> element instead
	<button>CLICKME!</button> ...you can also style it


--------------States------------
- Some links are blue, some are purple, etc... Why?
	- a:link		a normal, unvisited link
	- a:visited 	has been visited
	- a:hover		activated by mouse (touchscreens....?)
	- a:focus		activated with the keyboard (tab)
	- a:active		is being clicked

------------Precedence of Rules-----------
- a:hover MUST come after a:link
- a:visited and a:active MUST come after a:hover

----------Styling lists-------------
- Number of properties beyond font, margin, etc...
	- list-style-type			{ list-style-type: upper-alpha; }
		- ordered lists
		- lower-roman, upper-roman, decimal, decimal-leading-zero, upper-alpha, lower-alpha, hebrew, armenian, ...

	- list-style-image			{ list-style-image: square url('icon.gif'); }
		- use a custom image instead of traditional marker

	- list-style-position
	- list-style
