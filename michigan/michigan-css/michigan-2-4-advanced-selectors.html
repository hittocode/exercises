-----------Styling Specific Objects--------------
- We have focused on type selectors
- what if you don't want to style all of the links, just some? Or just some of the lists?
- CSS gives you options

-------------CSS Selectors----------------------
- Some selectors follow the DOM (Document Object Model)
- Descendant selectors (nav a)
	- Style all of the anchor links inside a nav tag
- Child selectors (nav>a)
	- More constraining. The anchor elements must be a child of the nav, no intermediate tags, e.g. paragraph
- Adjacent sibling (hl + ol)
	- elements must be at same level and follow each other

---------------id Selectors----------------------
- #id selector
	- used to identify a single element in the DOM.
	- was used extensively for <div id="header">, <div id="footer">, etc.
	- There is a small movement to move the use of id OUT of CSS

<img src="logo.jpg" id="mainLogo" alt="logo"/>

#mainLogo {						
	border: 5px solid #0006CC;
	margin: 0 auto;
}

------------- Class selector--------------
- class selector
	- used to identify an element in the DOM that is part of a special class of items
	- think of thumbnail images, all of the links that are in the navgation, your social media images, etc...

<img src="cat.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Joe"/>
<img src="dog.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Bacon"/>
<img src="hamster.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Cheesy"/>


.thumb {
	border: 1px solid #0006CC;
	width: 20%;
}

---------classes vs ids------------
- syntax is "." and "#"
- classes can be used multiple times
- id should be unique

- Think of images and navigation bars
	- format numerous (but not all) images the same way
	- visually signify the current page

----------narrowing the scope------------
- as you get more advanced pages, you will want to narrow the scope of the action
- p.main -> paragraphs using main class
- header img.special -> paragraphs inside header that use special class

-----------Expanding the scope------------
- you can combine elements with a comma
	- p, hl, #main, .special {...rules to apply to all of them}

- Review: What happens when there are multiple rules for the same selector?
	- When there are conflicts, use the one processed most recently
	- UNLESS a rule has !important

------------More Attribute Selectors----------------
- Universal
	- * applies to every element on the page
	- Ackk!! Try this!
- Attribute Selectors
	- a[href='info.html']
- Pseudo-Classes
- Pseudo-Elements

-------------Attribute Selectors----------------
- You may want to search the DOM for certain elements that have an attribute you are looking for
	- All the images that use gif files....
	- All of the images that have empty alt text....
	- All of the links that go to government sites....

---------Using Operators--------------
- Operators can be used to find those attribute values you are looking for
	- ^ : match the beginning exactly
		a [href^='http://umich']
	- $ : match the end exactly
		img[src$ = '.png'] -> apply to .png images
	- * : wildcard
		a [href*='umich']

--------------WHEW!!----------------
- We have actually covered a lot in this short video
- Know that each of these ideas can merge. One element can have many classes and ids associated with it
	<li class="special early dark" id="main"/>

- Browser "starts at the top" and applies each rule, sometimes overriding earlier rules

--------------the Good news-----------
- You can use style sheets from others to style your code, just by adding class!
- You can override style sheets from others just by rewriting the class, or making your own version of it and linking it at last

--------------Review-------------------
- Type selectors can be combined to narrow the scope of where rules are applied
- An id is used to specify a specific element in a page
