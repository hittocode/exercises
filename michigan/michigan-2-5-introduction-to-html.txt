--------Images: it's more than the tag------------ 1:33

-many file types are widely supported: jpeg (jpg and jpeg), gif, and png
- svg and bmp are additional options
- file extensions must be included

- every image must be downloaded, so size can be a factor
- every image requires an http request

--------image sizes------------
- when you link to an image the browser displays the image as big (or small) as the file
- "quick" solutions - change file, use width/height attributes

-------using an editor--------
-editors can be used to permanently change the size of the image, only works on local files

- built-in software for this includes preview(mac) and paint(windows)

--------using attributes--------
-always strive to keep style out of your html files...but
-<img> tag includes width and height attributes


------default image size-------

<figure>
	<img src="imgs/ashtabula.jpg" width="500px" height="100px" alt="My house">  (can also use % instead of px, percentage is on window size)
	<figcaption>Default image size</figcaption>
</figure>


-----favicon-----
- you can put image/logo/icon next to the title of your page (in the tab)
-must go in <head> section
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="imgs/wd4elogo.png" />


---------Alt text attribute-------------
-provides a textual alternative to non-text content
-read by screen readers
-displayed in place of images
-provides semantic meaning for search engines

-----------creating good alt text-----------
-be accurate
-be succinct
-don't be redundant
-don't include "picture of..." or "graphic of..."

------------empty alt text-------------
-it's ok to leave alt text empty (null). decorative images used for non-informative purpose
- do not skip it though


------------review----------
-misuse of file extensions, filename, and the file paths are often a problem
- for now, style the height/width in the html code
